  - ...Hmm?
  - "Hey, tell me about that guy. The one who\u2019s supposed to be a great swordsman."
  - You are not a Shadowchaser, why did you live in Skyelk?
  - It's rare to see smile on your face.
  - Jinyun is his name.
  - Jinyun? Sounds familiar.
  - So where is he now? Has he left Skyelk?
  - The swordsmanship of Skyelk is developed from his heritage.
  - No wonder, I remember that name on the sword book Yulin gave me.
  - He was a man of the past. To most mortals, it was long ago. He was a general
    of the Yellow Emperor's army, and also a master swordsman. The only time that
    I saw him fighting with sword was in a campaign, and I have never seen such swordsmanship
    ever since.
  - How exactly was that swordsmanship?
  - So, if you know him, does it mean you have lived for almost four thousand years?
  - Jinyun once said that the art of swords was the art of killing. One must wield
    the sword with the determination to slay the ghouls and gods.
  - How arrogant. To slay the ghouls and gods...
  - For our Haunts, once we grow mature, it's common to live for a few thousands
    of years.
  - Four hundred years ago, I was gravely wounded. I retired to the Ancient Cloister,
    for the chaotic energy that filled the place could help me recover.
  - Were you wounded by demons that tried to invade Skyelk?
  - So, have you recovered?
  - The Spirit Realm is vast, and Skyelk is just a corner. There are many feys and
    demons with great power in other parts of the realm. I wasn't their enemy. But
    when we fought, it was always a matter of life and death, and one doesn't blame
    another for taking their life.
  - What's that all about?
  - Is the promise between you and Xuange really that important? You left the place
    without being fully recovered, did you also lose a bet to him?
  - I wanted to be stronger by training myself in battle, so I will never resent
    myself for not having power when I need it. Living or demise, fighting or death,
    such is the way of many feys and demons. The mortals on this land used to live
    the same way in the ancient past, didn't they?
  - Hmm, living or demise, fighting or death...
  - ...also?
  - My power as it is right now is nothing compared to when I was in my prime.
  - Did I smile...?
  - ...
  - Back
